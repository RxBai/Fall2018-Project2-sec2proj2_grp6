### Code lib Folder

The lib directory contains various files with function definitions (but only function definitions - no code that actually runs).

na_process.R is used to fill in NA values.

timeSeries.R takes in selected zip codes, uses auto.arima to do prediction and return the new time series.

ZillowApi.R and showPopupHover.R work together takeing input longitude, latitude and housing data, showing the address, price, type, size, year built and appliance of a house on the map.
