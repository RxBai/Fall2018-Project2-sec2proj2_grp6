# Project 2: Shiny App Development Version 2.0
### App folder

The App directory contains the app files for the Shiny App (i.e., ui.r and server.r).

The www sub folder contains a css file and other files for the App's exterior design.

## How to use the App
+ All about Rental
  + You may choose 3 features that you are concerned about most, and even give weight to them. Set price range and house type. If you have a prefered zipcode, you may also add it to filter. Then you will see our recommendation for you.
  + Houses will be shown on the dot map beside. If you don't have a zipcode preference, just zoom in and zoom out on the dot map and you will see filtered choices in different regions.
  + You may also zoom in to see the neighbourhood and a hover showing an image of the house and other detailed informations.
  + If you already have a candidate apartment, the 'Do I Have a Good Deal' section will let you know if the price is fair.
+ Zipcode Comparison
  + You may select your concerned zipcodes (4 at most), features, cuisines, safety issues, and preferred travel, night life and recreation methods, and the Neighbourhood Features Tab shows you what position the zipcode area is in each features.
  + The Time Series Tab shows you the historical trend of median prices of selected zipcode areas.
  + Just for your reference, the Prediction Tan provides predicted median prices of selected zipcode areas in the next 12 months.
